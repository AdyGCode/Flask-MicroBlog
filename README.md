# Flask-MicroBlog
Based on the tutorial by Miguel Grinberg

The original [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) has been modified, and some items not completed.

This version has made a template for the navigation, header and footer components of the page, it also has a Jinja Macro to convert Newlines into <br/> within the posts.
